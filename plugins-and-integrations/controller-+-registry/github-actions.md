## VM Template & Tag Requirements

1. Github Runner has been installed inside of the VM. We recommend using [our script](https://github.com/veertuinc/getting-started/tree/master/GITHUB_ACTIONS) for this.

## Usage

Usage guides can be found in the repositories. You will want to start with [anka-actions-up](https://github.com/veertuinc/anka-actions-up).
