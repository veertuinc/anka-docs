| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `shared` | The default network type operating as NAT + DHCP. Every VM after the start/resume gets an IP address assigned by the internal DHCP server in range `192.168.64.2 - 192.168.64.254`. Programs inside a VM can access external networks (outside the host) and the internet directly. Also, other VMs on the host are also accessible. This mode typically works with multiple interfaces on the host. Note: In order for your VM to see and use other interfaces on the host, you need to ensure the main interface for the host has at least one DNS server configured. |
| `host` | It is very similar to the shared one, but the VM get IP addresses from range `192.168.128.2 - 192.168.128.254` and canâ€™t access external networks outside of the host. |
| `bridge` | The Bridged type will cause the VM to show in the network as an individual device and receive a unique IP separate from the host. {{< rawhtml >}}<br /><br /><blockquote><p>An ENV is available to set the interface name: `ANKA_BRIDGE_NAME=en0`</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When using the bridge, port-forwarding is not necessary as the VM will receive a unique IP that will be accessible directly to all other devices on the network.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>By default, DHCP will not see your VM's MAC address. You'll need to enable `--mac` for the network-card: `anka modify VmName --type bridge --mac {MAC HERE}`</p></blockquote>{{< /rawhtml >}} |
| `disconnected` | The VM will have a disconnected network cable. |
| `nat` | Experimental network mode for Apple Silicon/ARM, allowing at a minimum 2x the speed compared to the `shared` mode. Does not support VM to Host isolation or ARP Spoofing prevention. |
