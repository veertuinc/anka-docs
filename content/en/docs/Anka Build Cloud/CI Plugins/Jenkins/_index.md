  Instructions on how to use Jenkins with Anka Build Cloud
---

The Jenkins **Anka Plugin** provides a quick way to integrate Anka Build Cloud with Jenkins. The plugin helps Jenkins jobs dynamically provision Anka VM instances (based on the label used).

- Support for both **Pipeline** and **Freestyle** Jenkins jobs.
- Supports both Static Slave Templates (under Configure Clouds) and Dynamic Labelling (in your repo's Jenkinsfile).
- The VMs become deleted after every job finishes.
- Supports automated VM Tag creation after your jobs run. This Cache Builder feature helps optimize subsequent builds as the dependencies are already on the VM.
- Supports both **JNLP** and **SSH** based connections to Anka VMs.
  
> Since v1.20, the Slave Template builder plugin merged with the Anka Plugin. Be sure to uninstall the old Slave Template builder plugin if you're upgrading to v1.20.

> In order to follow these instructions, you will need to [install the Anka CLI]({{< relref "docs/Anka CLI/installation.md" >}}) and an understanding of how to [start the VM]({{< relref "docs/Anka CLI/command-reference.md#start-vm" >}}) and [launch the viewer]({{< relref "docs/Anka CLI/command-reference.md#open-vm-windowviewer" >}}).

## VM Template & Tag Requirements

The Jenkins Anka Plugin requires a VM with Java, SSH sharing, and port forwarding:

> The below list are the absolute neccessities needed to execute commands in a VM through your CI. You may have to include other dependencies (like git) depending on your setup.

1. In the VM, install the proper OpenJDK version.
    - Within Jenkins, visit **/systemInfo** (`System Properties`) and look for `java.version`.
    - Use the value to determine the proper OpenJDK version you need to download and install in your VM Template. For example if the `java.version` is set to `1.8.0_242`, you can download and install the [AdoptOpenJDK jdk8u242-b08.pkg](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk8-binaries/releases).
2. In the VM, make sure remote login is enabled (`System Preferences > Sharing`).
3. On the host, enable [port forwarding]({{< relref "docs/Anka CLI/command-reference.md#example---add-port-forwarding" >}}) for your VM Template using the Anka CLI.
> _We recommend not specifying `--host-port`._
4. `sudo anka suspend {VM Template name}`
5. `sudo anka registry push {VM Template name} {Tag name}`

## Install and Configure the Anka Plugin in Jenkins

> These steps are based on Jenkins 2.222.1. Your version and UI may differ slightly.

1. Navigate to `Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins` and click on the **Available** tab. Search in **Filter** for "Anka", then install it. _You won't see any results if it's already installed._

2. Now you can configure the Anka Cloud. Navigate to `Manage Jenkins > Manage Nodes and Clouds` and find the section called `Configure Clouds`. Inside of `Configure Clouds`, click on **Add a new Cloud** at the bottom of the page and then click on **Anka Cloud**.

3. You now have an Anka Cloud panel exposed to do your configuration. You can set **Anka Build Cloud** to be anything you want. However, you'll need to set **Build Controller URL with port** to the proper URL of your controller, and _**make sure you include the port**_: `http://<ip/domain>:80`. Once you're done, click **Save**.

At this point you can either setup [Static Labels]({{< relref "#creating-static-labels" >}}) under Configure Cloud or use [Dynamic Labelling]({{< relref "#using-dynamic-labelling" >}}) in your Jenkinsfile. 
- **Static Labels** are set up through a **Slave Template** and can then be referenced in your pipeline or job definitions. 
- **Dynamic Labels** are set up inside of the Jenkinsfile inside of a pipeline, stage, or step-level definition.

### Creating Static Labels

1. Return to `Manage Nodes and Clouds > Configure Clouds`. You should now see a **VM Templates** and **Slave Templates** section. Make sure **Show Templates** is checked and click on **Add**. This creates a new Slave Template you can edit.

2. Under the Slave Template, you want to select the proper **Template** and **Tag** or leave it to the default value to select the latest Tag in the Registry.

3. Leave **# of Executors** to 1.  

4. Enter the VM user's home path in **Remote FS Root**. If you didn't set up a new user for Jenkins on the VM, you could use the default **anka** user:  `/Users/anka/`.

5. Enter a value in **Labels** that you can then use in your jobs.  

6. Select the **SSH** or **JNLP** method for connection between Jenkins and your Anka VMs.
    - SSH: You'll need to add the proper user credentials to Jenkins. If you're using the default user on the VM, use the user: `anka` and pass: `admin`.
    - JNLP: This method downloads an agent.jar and the slave-agent.jnlp file from the **Jenkins URL** you've set in your System Configuration into the VM. If the Jenkins URL doesn't resolve inside of the VM (like if it's set to http://localhost), you won't be able to use JNLP. _If you're seeing any problems post-creation of the agent inside of Jenkins, check the running VMs `/tmp/log.txt` for errors._

7. Enter a value for **Slave name template**. Provisioned VMs names will contain this value.

8. You can also pass Environment Variables into the VM.

9. Select a **Node Group** if you want VMs provisioned on a specific group defined in your Anka Build Cloud. _Available only in Enterprise and Enterprise Plus Tiers._

10. Enter **Priority** for VM provisioning. _Available only in Enterprise and Enterprise Plus Tiers._

11. Save the settings.  
  
> You can create multiple Slave Template profiles!

### Using Dynamic Labelling

> Dynamic Labelling requires two plugins: **GitHub Authentication plugin** and **Pipeline**.

This section describes the steps to create dynamic labels inside of your Jenkinsfile using the `createDynamicAnkaNode` function.

- The `createDynamicAnkaNode` function starts a VM and returns a unique label for it.
- The returned label can be interpolated in your pipeline, stage, or step-level definitions. ([Example](https://github.com/veertuinc/jenkins-dynamic-label-example/blob/simple-example/Jenkinsfile))
- `createDynamicAnkaNode` has all the configuration options that the UI configured Static Slave Template has.
- This allows you to have only a minimal Anka Cloud configuration and define Anka Nodes on the fly.
   
> Jenkins has a Pipeline Snippet Generator, which helps you craft your `createDynamicAnkaNode` definition. You can find it in your Jenkins instance at `/pipeline-syntax`.

#### `CreateDynamicAnkaNode` Parameters

> You can obtain the "masterVmId" (VM UUID) using: `sudo anka show <Template name> uuid`

**Name** | **Type** | **Default Value** |  **Description** |  **Required**
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
masterVmId | String | -  | UUID of the VM Template | Yes

nameTemplate | string | -  | Label to use in VM instance names (There are several variables available for interpolation: $Template_name, $Template_id, or $ts) | -
priority | int | -  | Override the default priority (lower is more urgent) | -
saveImage | boolean | `false` | Save the VM as a Tag before terminating it | -
suspend | boolean | `false` | When saving the Tag, suspend the VM before the push | -
TemplateId | string | -  | When saving the Tag, push onto a specific Template UUID | -
pushTag | string | -  | When saving the Tag, set the Tag name (A timestamp will be appended) | -
deleteLatest | boolean | `false` | When saving the Tag, delete the latest Tag for the Template out of the registry before pushing (Dangerous: only use if the Template isn't holding other project tags) | -
TemplateDescription | string | -  | When saving the Tag, set a description for the new Tag | -
group | string | -  | Group ID to start the instance in (_Available only in Enterprise and Enterprise Plus Tiers_) | -
numberOfExecutors | int | `1` | Number of Jenkins executors to run on the Node (we recommend 1) | -

#### Dynamic Jenkinsfile Example

```javascript
def NODE_LABEL = createDynamicAnkaNode(
  masterVmId: 'e1173284-39df-458c-b161-a54123409280'
)
pipeline {
  agent {
    label "${NODE_LABEL}"
  }
  stages {
    stage("hello") {
      steps {
        sh "echo hello"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- In this example, the pipeline uses the "NODE_LABEL" variable defined at the beginning of the file.
- The function call starts an instance with the Template UUID 'e1173284-39df-458c-b161-a54123409280' and returns a unique label, preventing any other external step or pipeline from using it. Any unspecified parameters have their default values, as indicated in the parameter list above.
- The sh step waits until the instance is up and the node is connected to Jenkins before it runs.

## Using the Cache Builder (Optional)

Cache Tag building is useful when you need to automate the preparation of a VM with dependencies. You can then execute your jobs using this Tag/VM and avoid having to prepare the dependencies over and over again before the build, or test commands run, usually resulting in significant bandwidth and time savings.
  
> The plugin will push to the Registry for any buildStatus except for **FAILURE**, **ABORTED**, or **UNSTABLE**.
> You can wrap your step-level commands in `catchError(buildResult: 'FAILURE', stageResult: 'FAILURE')` or use the Build **Execute shell** advanced **Exit code to set build unstable** setting to prevent the VM from pushing.

### Configuring Caching for Static Slave Templating

You can find the **Cache Builder** in the Anka Cloud Slave Template definition under `Manage Jenkins > Manage Nodes and Clouds > Configure Clouds`.

![image11](/images/using-controller/image11.png)

**Target Template** : A dropdown list of Templates and UUIDs.

**Tag** : Specify a name for the Tag here. However, the current date is appended onto the end: If I use `project1` in this field, I'll end up with a Tag named `project1_20200408121026` in my Registry. (Optional; If left empty, it uses the Jenkins jobname)

**Description** : Description for the VM being pushed (Optional).

**Suspend** : If selected, it will suspend the VM before pushing the Tag. Otherwise, it will stop the VM before pushing.

**Delete Latest Tag** : Deletes the **latest Tag** from the Template/Registry before pushing the newly generated Tag. This is useful to optimize disk space usage.
  > WARNING: This can delete Tags unrelated to your cache builder configuration.

**Wait For Build Finish** : This causes the plugin to wait until the entire to job finish before pushing the new Tag to the Registry.
  > WARNING: Using the `Wait for Build Finish` option in combination with ankaGetSaveImageResult results in a deadlock.

#### Using the Post Build Step with Static Slave Templates

![image12](/images/anka-build/controller01.png)

**Fail build** : Will set the build as failed if the `image save request` failed (or timed out). If this is not selected, the Post Build Step does nothing.

**Timeout** : Sets the minutes to wait for the Tag push to Registry to complete (this needs to be determined manually or with trial and error).

#### Using a Jenkinsfile with the Static Slave Template

Pipelines can have multiple agents running in one build (also in parallel). Therefore, the plugin relies on the buildResult to tell if it needs to execute the "save image request". You have two options to prevent pushing the new Tag prematurely:

1. Wrap your step-level commands in a catchError ([from our Nested Example](https://github.com/veertuinc/jenkins-dynamic-label-example/blob/nested-example/Jenkinsfile)):
    ```javascript
    stage("run-on-NESTED_LABEL-vm") {
      agent { label "${NESTED_LABEL}" }
      steps {
        // If buildResults == 'FAILURE', Anka will not push the NESTED_LABEL VM. Example:
        catchError(buildResult: 'FAILURE', stageResult: 'FAILURE') {
          sh 'uname -r;'
        }
      }
    }
    ```
2. Enable **Wait For Build Finish**

### Configuring Caching with Dynamic Labelling

Please review our [Nested Example](https://github.com/veertuinc/jenkins-dynamic-label-example/blob/nested-example/Jenkinsfile).

- The **AGENT_LABEL** VM instance is created to handle the first stage.
- The second stage creates a second VM instance that is configured to push to the Registry once the buildResult is a successful status.
  
> If buildResult receives any of the failed statuses (**FAILURE**, **ABORTED**, or **UNSTABLE**), the **ankaGetSaveImageResult** outputs `Checking save image status… Done!` in the Jenkins job logs/console since there is no push operation to wait on.

#### Using the Post Build Step with Dynamic Labelling

Create an `ankaGetSaveImageResult` Pipeline step:

```javascript
stage("check-generated-tag-from-nested-vm") {
  steps {
    script {
      def getPushResult = ankaGetSaveImageResult( shouldFail: true, timeoutMinutes: 120 )
      echo "ankaGetSaveImageResult Returned: $getPushResult"
    }
  }
}
```

If you're creating multiple cache Tags in a single pipeline, The `ankaGetSaveImageResult` function returns true if all previous image save calls for this particular build have executed.

**Name** | **Type** | **Default Value** |  **Decription** |  **Required**
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
shouldFail | boolean | true | Fails the job if one of the image save requests has failed or timed out | 
timeoutMinutes | int | 120 | Stops waiting for the result of the Tag -> Registry push after x minutes. |

> Remember, `ankaGetSaveImageResult` returns true immediately if nothing pushes to the Registry in a failed build.

## Notes on using the Cache Builder
- How often should I cache? : The answer depends on the VM size after you prepare it and also the density of your builds.
- **The cache build should have a job or pipeline of its own.** Caching after every "regular" build might not make sense as the time that it takes to download code or artifacts is usually the same or shorter than the time it takes to push the Tag to the Registry.
- You should run your cache build once and check how much time the operation takes. The push can be a few gigabytes and might take some time on slower networks.
- Only one Tag can push at a time. You can execute multiple cache builds for the same Template, but those requests end up executing serially. 
- If your build/preparation is fast, you can consider running cache builds a few times a day or even based on commits.
- If your cache build is slow, consider running one cache build per day (you can schedule it for a time that Jenkins is not busy).
