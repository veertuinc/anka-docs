Great! Now that we have our Anka Controller & Registry up and running, let's add Nodes!

## Step 3. Link the Anka CLI Node to the Controller

> Perform the following steps on the Node where you created your first VM Template.

### Add the Registry

We now need to configure the Registry on this machine so we can push/upload the local VM Template we created earlier. Uploading the Template to the Registry makes it possible to download and run it from other nodes.

_Assuming you haven't changed the default port configuration, your Registry is serving requests on port `8089`._

```shell
sudo anka registry add <registry name here> http://<ip>:8089
```

Verify the configuration:
```shell
sudo anka registry list-repos
++
++

<registry name you set> (default)

+--------+------------------+
| host   | <the ip you set> |
+--------+------------------+
| scheme | http             |
+--------+------------------+
| port   | 8089             |
+--------+------------------+
```
Then, confirm the registry list command doesn't throw any failures:
```shell
sudo anka registry list
```

### Push the VM to the Registry
```shell
sudo anka registry push mojave-base -t base
```

After the push completes, you should see your new Template in the "Templates" section of the controller UI.

### Join to the Controller & Registry

```shell
sudo ankacluster join http://<ip>
Password:
Testing connection to controller...: Ok
Testing connection to the registry...: Ok
Ok
Cluster join success
```

- Replace `<ip>` with the IP of the machine hosting your controller:
- If you changed the default port for the controller from 80, you'll need to use the new port at the end of the IP. Otherwise, leave it off.

The command may hang for a few moments and then display `Cluster join success`. Please report any errors you find to support@veertu.com.

> Repeat this process on other Nodes that you want to join (after installing Anka CLI).

## Step 4. Start a VM instance using the Controller UI

1. Go to your Controller dashboard and click on the **Instances** tab:

    ![your instances view](/images/getting-started/instances.png)

2. Click on **Create Instance(s)**, and the **Create New Instances** view displays:

    ![new instances view](/images/getting-started/new-instance.png)

3. Select the VM Template and click **Start**. The **Create New Instances** view closes and returns you to the **Instances** view. You should now see the Instance in a **Scheduling** or **Pulling** **State**:
    ![a scheduling instance](/images/getting-started/scheduling.png)

4. After the **Scheduling** and **Pulling** finishes, the VM starts on one of the Nodes and shows a **Started** **State** in the Controller UI:

    ![a started instance](/images/getting-started/started-vm.png)

You can now confirm the Instance is running from inside the Node:
