## What is Anka Develop?

Anka Develop is a free, but limited version, of our Anka Virtualization software.

## How does it differ from Anka Build, Flow, and Secure?

Anka Develop is currently restricted to running a single VM at a time. It also does not include suspension, tagging, or use of the registry CLI commands. Finally, it will only function on Apple Macbook hardware.

## How to install Anka Develop?

You can follow the normal [Installing Anka Virtualization package]({{< relref "docs/Getting Started/installing-the-anka-virtualization-package.md" >}}) guide. If you're on Macbook hardware, the license will be activated by default.
