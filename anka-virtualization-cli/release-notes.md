{{< hint info >}}
Addons upgrade is not required.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint warning >}}

ARM/Silicon specific issues:

- 15.0 Host OS currently has an issue where connecting to the VM over port forwarding for the first time after installing Anka will show a prompt on the host's desktop saying `"Allow ankahv-arm64 to find devices on local networks"`. You will need to manually approve this until a solution is provided by Apple.
- Nested virtualization is not functional inside of VMs yet.
- Changing the display resolution dynamically fails.
- Physical device capture outside of USB devices like keyboard and "pointing" is not possible.

{{< /hint >}}

- [Download Anka-3.6.1.198.pkg](https://downloads.veertu.com/anka/Anka-3.6.1.198.pkg)

## Previous Versions

### 3.6.0 (3.6.0.197) - December 10th, 2024

{{< hint info >}}
Addons upgrade is not required.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint warning >}}

ARM/Silicon specific issues:

- 15.0 Host OS currently has an issue where connecting to the VM over port forwarding for the first time after installing Anka will show a prompt on the host's desktop saying `"Allow ankahv-arm64 to find devices on local networks"`. You will need to manually approve this until a solution is provided by Apple.
- Nested virtualization is not functional inside of VMs yet.
- Changing the display resolution dynamically fails.
- Physical device capture outside of USB devices like keyboard and "pointing" is not possible.

{{< /hint >}}

- [Download Anka-3.6.0.197.pkg](https://downloads.veertu.com/anka/Anka-3.6.0.197.pkg)
- **New Feature:** [You can now install multiple versions of Anka on the same host.]({{< relref "whats-new/anka-3.6.0/index.md#ability-to-install-multiple-versions-of-anka-on-the-same-host" >}})
- **New Feature:** [arm ec2 mac] Support for IMDSv2 on our >= 3.6.0 marketplace AMIs.
- **Improvement:** Support for M4 macbooks running Anka Develop license.
- **Improvement:** [arm] Eliminated `ankanetd`, similar to what we already have done with intel, moving it into the hypervisor for better performance and stability.
- **Improvement:** Support for 15.1.1 in `anka create --list`.
- **Bug Fix:** `anka registry` was not showing push and pull commands.
- **Bug Fix:** Overcommitting RAM was throwing "Bad Address" which is unclear.
- **Bug Fix:** [arm] `anka view` now opens the Viewer window properly.
- **Bug Fix:** `ANKA_NETWORK_MODE=disconnected` was not working. Note: This is useful for Proxy users who cannot get past the macOS setup process due to the internet requirement from Apple. It will create the VM without internet, get past the setup phase that fails, and then you can use `anka modify {vm} network` to enable shared or bridged networking again.
- **Bug Fix:** Changing the language in the VM reverts post-reboot of the VM.
- **Bug Fix:** A flaw in the renewal logic for licensing was preventing renewals from getting a new expiration date.

ARM issues:

- Nested virtualization is not functional inside of VMs yet.
- `anka view` is partially broken and require double clicking the VM name in the Anka.app VM listing. Both of these issues make VNC, which is enabled by default, a better route for accessing your VM.
- iCloud/Apple logins will fail inside of the VM. You can still log into your account through Apple's website and download apps through your developer account. Or, transfer them from the host into the VM with `anka cp`.
- Changing the display resolution dynamically fails.
- Physical device capture outside of USB devices like keyboard and "pointing" is not possible.

### 3.2.0 (3.2.0.154) (Intel) - Jan 9th 2023

{{< hint info >}}
Addons upgrading from Anka 2.x is not required but is recommended.
{{< /hint >}}

- VMs suspended on Anka 2.x will need to be re-suspended on 3.x.
- The Controller Agent version that comes with Anka will start at `1.30.1` (ARM will be `1.22.0`). **Older versions of the Controller do not support Anka 3. You will need to upgrade your controller to at least 1.30.1.**
- Previously, `anka create` would create a suspended VM. Starting in this version, VMs are stopped.
- GUI (Anka.app) VM creation will produce a VM without macOS set up.
- `anka --machine-readable registry list` has a key name change from `id` to `uuid`.
- The `modify set` commands are deprecated and will not show in the `anka modify --help` output. Please migrate to using the new modify commands instead.
- Only macOS 10.15 guest version and above are supported by Veertu. If you're using an older version, do not upgrade addons to 3.x and they will continue to function.
