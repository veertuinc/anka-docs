## Current Version

### 1.40.0 (1.40.0-95a63938) - December 6th, 2023

{{< hint warning >}}
**This release is for native macOS package users only.**
{{< /hint >}}

- This release splits the Combined MacOS Package into two packages. [Please see our upgrade guide.]({{< relref "anka-build-cloud/upgrading-to-1.40.0-on-macos.md" >}})
- The standalone macOS Registry package has been modernized to match the controller. You can read more about the changes [here]({{< relref "anka-build-cloud/getting-started/setup-controller-and-registry-mac.md#registry-1" >}}).

## Previous Versions

### 1.39.0 (1.39.0-d35842e6) - November 20th, 2023

- **New Feature:** We've added a task queue + listing element in the UI showing status of bulk actions like adding groups to nodes, changing node configuration, and will be improved to include other actions over time. It will show on the Controller UI in the bottom right.
- **New Feature:** [The Start Instance now supports setting the Port Forwarding for a VM before start]({{< relref "anka-build-cloud/working-with-controller-and-API.md#example-for-port_forwarding_override" >}}).
- **New Feature:** The Start Instance now supports setting the VM's Network Mode.
- **New Feature:** [The Start Instance now supports changing the VM's disk size]({{< relref "anka-build-cloud/working-with-controller-and-API.md#example-for-disk" >}}).
- **Improvement:** Clarified UAK expiration functionality with a message on the Edit page.
- **Improvement:** UAK/TAP now works for HA environments.
- **Improvement:** Create Instance Node listing is now sorted by hostname.
- **Bug Fix:** Using the save image API/features with a non-existent tag caused a panic and Instance stuck in "Pushing".
- **Bug Fix:** Special characters in root password caused controller -> registry communication errors.
- **Bug Fix:** Port forwarding rule names now display properly on Instance page.
- **Bug Fix:** Bulk adding multiple nodes to a node group only sets it for one node. Note: The existing `node_ids` param in the API now only supports a single node ID.

### 1.38.0 (1.38.0-3989ee24) - Oct 24th, 2023

- **New Feature:** Resource Permissions for Permission Groups. We have a [new Authorization guide]({{< relref "anka-build-cloud/Advanced Security Features/authorization.md" >}}) you can read over to understand how this feature works.
  - At the moment Resource Management will disable Node Groups and break compatibility with CI/CD plugins for Jenkins, etc. We are working to add support soon.
- (Required ETCD Version: 3.5.7)

### 1.37.0 (1.37.0-4e3ffe71) - Aug 29th, 2023

- **Improvement:** MacOS Packages are now available for ARM64.
- **New Feature:** Ability to set `hw.serial` and `hw.uuid` through Controller API.
- **New Feature:** Ability to delete a Template from Nodes when deleting from the Controller UI Templates page.
- **Improvement:** Distribution is now supported for Nodes in Drain Mode.
- **Improvement:** Agent log improvement: "Version change detected! Stopping runner" -> "Anka version change detected! Stopping runner"
- **Improvement:** Agent log improvement: Template and Tag are now indicated in the Start VM logs.
- **Improvement:** All agent Start VM logs will now have the Request ID and Instance ID attached.
- **Bug Fix:** Some Registry API endpoints were using a mix of FAIL and ERROR in the returned JSON. To make consistent with the Controller API, they all now return FAIL.
- (Required ETCD Version: 3.5.7)

### 1.36.1 (1.36.1-efbe0727) - July 18th, 2023

- **Bug Fix:** (macOS package) ANKA_LOCAL_ANKA_REGISTRY ignored when TLS enabled.
  - Note: If you're running the registry on a different IP, and especially in your certs only allow specific IPs, you'll need to set `ANKA_REGISTRY_LISTEN_ADDRESS` to the `IP:PORT` vs the default `:PORT`.
- **Bug Fix:** Create Group modal is gray and unclickable.
- (Standalone Registry: 1.36.1-cced806b)
- (Required ETCD Version: 3.5.7)

### 1.36.0 (1.36.0-37d289c1) - July 18th, 2023

- **Bug Fix:** Race condition fixes with VM termination to avoid orphans.
- **Bug Fix:** Running the Anka docker package, the controller would be unable to write centralized logs.
- **Bug Fix:** (HA only) Improper handling of second VM start for same Instance leaving orphans.
- **Bug Fix:** Instance can go to started state even after termination request comes in.
- **Improvement:** Docker packages have been rewritten to:
  1. Eliminate .env files and instead include them directly in the `docker-compose.yml`
  1. Eliminate ENVs from Dockerfiles used to generate the images/tags in dockerhub. You will want to review [our new docker-compose.yml](https://docs.veertu.com/anka/anka-build-cloud/configuration-reference/#docker-composeyml-docker) to see which ENVs are now being set there by default and ensure they are also included in your docker-compose.yml (or .env files). For example, the Registry needs `ANKA_LISTEN_ADDR: :8089` and `ANKA_BASE_PATH: /mnt/vol` set in the config/yml.
- **Improvement:** Registry could (depending on configuration, enabled by default) start an additional un-secure server (on port 8085 by default) that is meant to be used by locally running Controller only. This un-secure server is no longer being ran by the Registry.
  - Configurations removed: `ANKA_INTERNAL_LISTEN_ADDR`, `ANKA_USE_HTTPS_INTERNAL`
  - **_Action required:_** Please ensure that any configuration using `ANKA_LOCAL_ANKA_REGISTRY` will instead point to the official 8089 port. Your TLS certificates may need to be updated to support a new address.
- **Improvement:** Registry standalone package for macOS will now automatically restart on failure.
- **Improvement:** MacOS Controller log directory is now 755 and readable by non-root users.
- **Improvement:** Removed debug logs like `Could not get instance`.
- **New Feature:** A VM is terminated as an orphan/"zombie" if a Node is reporting it 30 times (or more) and the Controller does not know which Instance to correlate it with. This can now be changed by setting `ANKA_UNKNOWN_VM_THRESHOLD`.
- (Standalone Registry: 1.36.0-f6c28a0a)
- (Required ETCD Version: 3.5.7)

### 1.35.0 (1.35.0-525badf3) - June 20th, 2023

- **New Feature:** The Controller Agent running on Nodes will now timeout when `anka start` commands take longer than 1m30s to complete. This can be controlled by setting `ankacluster join --cli-start-timeout {new time here}`.
- **Improvement:** Controller logs will now indicate when a Node has picked up the task to start a VM.
- (Standalone Registry: 1.35.0-16331641)

### 1.34.0 (1.34.0-4cda29d3) - June 8th, 2023

- **Improvement:** (AUTH ONLY) The Controller will now exclusively use the Root Token for communication and authentication with the Registry. This means that both the Registry and Controller **must** have AUTH enabled as well as the same Root Token in their configs. Several ENVs like `ANKA_API_KEY_`, `ANKA_CLIENT_`, and `ANKA_OIDC_` (registry only) are no longer available and necessary. They can be removed from your configuration, but be sure to mirror the AUTH configuration for Root Token and other ENVS from the Controller.
- **Bug Fix:** Azure registry `version upload failed` errors.
- **Bug Fix:** User API Keys button was missing from UI.
- **Bug Fix:** Azure backed registry not returning entire list of templates from API.
- **Bug Fix:** Azure Registry failing to clean failed pushes.
- (Standalone Registry: 1.33.0-20746877)

### 1.33.0 (1.33.0-5465bb03) - March 16th, 2023

- **Bug Fix:** Getting distribution status returned as null body with OK status.
- **Bug Fix:** Distribution was blocked for Unhealthy nodes.
- **Bug Fix:** Distribution (/api/v1/registry/vm/distribute) API response randomly showing `progress: 1` (100%) but `status: false` indefinitely.
- **Improvement:** [New Permissions Management Panel]({{< relref "whats-new/build-cloud-1.33.0/index.md#new-permissions-management-panel" >}})
- **Improvement:** [Code/Explicit Flow support for OIDC.]({{< relref "whats-new/build-cloud-1.33.0/index.md#codeexplicit-flow-oidc-support" >}})
  - ENV `ANKA_OIDC_CACHE_TTL` has been deprecated.
- **Improvement:** ETCD upgraded to 3.5.7.
- **New Feature:** [Kubernetes NGINX Ingress Controller Header Passthrough support.]({{< relref "whats-new/build-cloud-1.33.0/index.md#support-certificate-auth-with-for-nginx-ingress-in-kubernetes" >}})
- (Standalone Registry: 1.33.0-a2d41374)

### 1.32.0 (1.32.0-c375584c) - Feb 6th, 2023

- **New Feature:** [Drain Mode, allowing users to prevent any *new* VMs from starting on the node, but not terminate already running VMs and the jobs using them]({{< relref "whats-new/build-cloud-1.32.0/index.md#drain-mode" >}}).
- **New Feature:** [Certificate Revocation.]({{< relref "whats-new/build-cloud-1.32.0/index.md#certificate-revocation" >}})

- (Standalone Registry: 1.21.0-ced10c21)

{{< hint warning >}}
##### Known issues

Please note that there is a temporary workaround required for a bug that started in versions after 1.18.0 of the Controller/Registry agent which runs on your nodes. All versions of the agent, when noticing that the version of itself does not match the version of the controller, will perform a self-upgrade and restart. The restart seems to be problematic on some setups and leaves a zombie anka_agent process and and Offline status in the controller UI. To work around the bug when upgrading your controller/registry, you'll need to change the existing steps to include:
- Disjoining all of the nodes first
- Do the controller/registry upgrade
- Run `curl -O http://**{controllerUrlHere}**/pkg/AnkaAgent.pkg && sudo installer -pkg AnkaAgent.pkg -tgt /` on each node to download the new version
- And finally join each node back

<br />

**1.21.0 fixes this issue, so it will not be necessary for future releases.** Thanks for your understanding and we are sorry for the inconvenience this causes.
