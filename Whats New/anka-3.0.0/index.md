title: "Anka Virtualization 3.0.0"
---

This is our first full and stable release of the Anka 3 version supporting apple/M1 machines from Apple. You can expect vastly faster performance from builds/tests compared with Intel/Anka 2.

{{< hint warning >}}
This version does not have full feature parity with Anka 2 (intel). We are continuing to move toward parity and if a feature is missing which blocks your use of Anka 3 and M1 machines, please let us know.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint info >}}
Anka Build components support heterogeneous Build nodes. You can connect both both Intel and M1 nodes to a single controller and Registry.

You can get started by reading [our documentation for Anka 3.0.0]({{< relref "apple/Getting Started/_index.md" >}}).
